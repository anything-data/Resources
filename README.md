3. **data-science/**: Dedicated to data science topics, including machine learning, deep learning, and statistical modeling.
4. **textbooks/**: A collection of textbooks and reference materials spanning various topics in data science, engineering, and analysis.
5. **tools/**: Features tools and utilities that are useful for data-related tasks.
6. **websites-and-platforms/**: Lists websites and platforms that provide valuable resources for learning and collaboration.
